# Tensorflow Face 624 ppl
 I wrote some face recognition code for tensorflow


Currently you will need to put in already cropped images or possibly just ones with only one face in them. 
Will add autocrop in the next few days

To test an image, make a folder 'put test image here' and put any images in there(takes multiple if needed)
